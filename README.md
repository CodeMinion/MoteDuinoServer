MoteDuino Server
- Script to be loaded on an Arduino to allow you to send commands from the MoteDuino Android app over Bluetooth and be able to control your TV.

Note: This contains the TV codes for my Sanyo TV since you probably have a different TV you'll need to replace the codes with your own TV codes. The LIRC project is a good place to find the codes for your TV (http://lirc-remotes.sourceforge.net/remotes-table.html).
